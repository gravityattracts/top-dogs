				<h5 class='author-id'>By: Juan Yates</h5>
				<p>Almost everyone has had at least one dog, if not multiple. Even if not, you probably know a couple people, be them friends or family members, who have dogs. As an avid dog lover and owner, I am going to go over my subjective top 5 favorite dog breeds. Lets begin!</p>

			<h2 class='title dog-breed'>1. Border Collie</h2>

				<p>The Border Collie easily takes the cake as my favorite dog breed. They are supremely intelligent (<a href='https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/border-collie/#:~:text=Border%20Collies%20are%20the%20brainiacs,energy%2C%20loyalty%2C%20and%20friendliness.' target='_blank'>perhaps the smartest breed of dog</a>), which paired with their agreeable and friendly nature, medium size, and loyalty, makes for a dog that easily trainable and great for first-time owners.</p>
			<h2 class='title dog-breed'>2. Pit Bull</h2>

				<p>While controversial, pit bulls can be one of the most friendly and loyal dogs you can ask for. Dubbed the 'nanny dog', they are known for their calm temparament around children. While pit bulls are a larger breed, they are very intelligent and don't require much physical care beyond basic hygiene. There are also many types of pit bulls to choose from, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>American Pit Bull</li>
					<li>Bluenose Pit Bull</li>
					<li>Rednose Pit Bull</li>
					<li>Colby Pit Bull</li>
					<li id='cliffhanger'>... And more!</li>
				</ul>
			<h2 class='title dog-breed'>3. Redbone Coonhound</h2>

				<p>While not a universally popular breed, you have surely heard of the <strong>Redbone Coonhound</strong> if you have read the book <em>Where The Red Fern Grows</em>, a book about a young boy who saves his money to buy two of these beautiful dogs and teaches them how to hunt, building an inseparable bond with them. The Redbone Coonhound is an esteemed hunting dog, with a keen sense of smell, sight, and hearing. This, paired with their above-average intelligence, makes them great at tracking, chasing, and catching prey. Not to mention that they are friendly and great as family pets. These dogs pair best with an active owner or someone with a large property.</p>
			<h2 class='title dog-breed'>4. Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
				<img src='https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/4/Cute-Yorkshire-Terrier-Dog-PNG.png' width='160' alt='An adorable yorkie' title='An adorable yorkie'>
				<p>The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size dog, being one of the smallest dog breeds in the world. Don't let the Yorkie's daintiness fool you. While brave and bossy, <em>'Yorkies'</em> are brave, intelligent, and make great family pets, especially for those who are looking for a smaller dog. Let's not forget to mention that they are simply adorable!!</p>
			<h2 class='title dog-breed'>5. German Shepherd</h2>
				<img src='https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/4/German-Shepherd-Dog-PNG-Photo.png' width='190' alt='Image of a german shepherd dog' title='A German Shepherd'>
				<p>The German Shepherd is an intelligent, friendly, and fiercely loyal medium-sized dog. They have earned their service dog reputation, being utilized by the military, police, disabled, etc. They are easy to train and can are good for families.</p>
